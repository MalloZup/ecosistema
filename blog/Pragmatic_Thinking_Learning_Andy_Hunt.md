# Pragmatic Thinking and Learning Refactor Your Wetware by Andy Hunt

"Software Development happens in your head not in an editor, IDE or design tool"
Cit: Andy Hunt

There's just so much positive to say about this book.

This book is not the classic book about programming and is not a book that you read quickly.

You will need to allocate some time for reading it. 
It is not a  big book, but you will need time in  order to experiment the various tips/techniques that the author suggest you.

And also you will need to take time to reflect about the content and make it yours.

I would reccomend this book also to non-programmer/devs; allthough Andy speak in a technicall/software fashion this book handle accessible subjects.

Some random central points.

- Creative mode vs logical mode:

As developer we might think we are creative and also logical person. If you ever asked yourself how you can improve both modes (no matter the work you do), you might read this book.

- create a learning plan with objectives.

I really found this tip usefull; living as coder nowdays require a learning plan, otherwise you just jump over framework over framework, new language over language and learning confusely.

It is much more harder to create a learning plan, but in the end it pays off, even if the whole story is not about following the plan 1:1  but is more about the "planning", and having a vision.

I think that trying to see where you want to go and also which concept interest you, this can make the difference in longterm, and you will need to etablish some objective/task/discipline for getting there.

So you might read this book if you are interested on it.

- Explore new ways for learning/thinking.

A part for having a plan, it is impressive the meta-reflectin on how works the brain, how you can focus and learn about how to learn ( such things that everybody assumes for well-known but nobody teach you really) 

At the end of each chapters you will have some exercises.

I have found really lot of inspiration by reading this book and pragmatic knowledge.

Highly recommended for all knowledge workers and thinkers!
