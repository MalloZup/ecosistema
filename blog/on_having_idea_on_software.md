# On having ideas in software.

When you work on  bigger, cordinated codebases, you might follow a design model already written by somebody else.

This is fine since we don't spend time on examine that algorithm, design.

For example if you are doing a [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) Application, you follow in the global design the MVC design, allthough in software we can analyze design vertically, so that even if your design is a MVC on the bigger view, on the low level you will have another design paradigm.

When we code lot of code or the tasks is not super difficult, we have the impression to be on a "flow" condition; beeing in a flow condition is benifical for a creative human, but software as other creative activities follow a design model which might to be discussed from time to time, or maybe not at all.

For example, as a painter you can draw 300 pictures using the same technique. And you might be happy and sucessfull for that.
Or, you might start asking your self about the model and trying to use something else. How can draw this picture differenlty with another technique?

In software we have different constraints, but what we have forgotten in our centralized world, is  to embrace different perspective for the same idea.

We most take as granted that the X opensource library solve the problem already in the most elegant way, or that our communication app is the only one possible.

E.g new models of communication are already possible, for example https://mastodon.social/about, but the users consciences are not yet sensibilized to it.
And other technologies or application more sensible to user privacy could be more popolar. But the conscience of users for data is not awaken.

In a way, we don't spend enough time to doubt about what we take as granted. We trust the so called experts, which are centralized and maybe from the same country or company.

Beeing awake is not easy. From the political and also from a technical point. How often do we try to view with our eyes a problem?

From etymology, Idea means:

The word idea comes from Greek ἰδέα idea "form, pattern," from the root of ἰδεῖν idein, "to see."  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea#Etymology).

To see the things in the software world require time, passion and experience. This in the context when you try to design things.

Unfortunately most of the time, software projects doesn't provide any spefications, in term of system design. UML has been around for some times but personally I never used and seen it in action.

We need clearly a  balance between over-formalizing a system and not specify it at all. But the techniques for design software are not well researched or universal. Everybody use more or less his convention,.

But if even a project is wonderful designed, it can be an arid project without any usefullness.
We have lot of opensource projects which focus either on developer productivity, or on big companies need.

Idea for empowering individual non-developers, normal user and small companies are rare.

Finally, even if a project is well designed and usefull for a real community, you will need to communicate your idea.

As human even for communicate ideas, we take a lot of shortcuts. We think that as developer having our Project in GitHub, and then posting it via Twitter and other social network will make the "communication" part.

The shortcut is that we don't think with a local mind. A Bar in Lyon, want to make happy and money from the local people of the quartier of Lyon.
It doesn't post in social networks the prize of the coffes everyday! People will maybe do mostly and judgde the bar.

So having new ideas, it might seems difficult because we as developer we might only focus on the technical aspect and forget the social, and local perspectives that make an idea unique. Our centralized World-Web give also us a sense that everything is already written which it isn't.
Also we live in a epoch where everybody see itself as paladin of freedom and want to help not 2/3 Peoples but million of people. ( a side effect of our centralized world)
